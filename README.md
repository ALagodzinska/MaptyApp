With this app, you can easily track your workouts. Start with simply clicking on the location on the map where you started your workout and continue to draw the route. 
After you finish drawing the route, small form will appear where you can specify and choose from two workout types - Cycling or Running. Distance will be calculated automatically based on the route that you drew, all you need to add is duration of your workout and cadance or elevcation gain based on your workout type. 

All your workouts will be displayed on the sidebar, from there you are able to click on workout and map will move to the chosen workout location.
